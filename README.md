# Python DSA Track 🚀

Welcome to the **Python DSA Track** repository!
This repo is a public learning journal and resource hub based on the *"Complete Python with DSA Bootcamp"* I'm currently following. My goal is to document my learning, build a solid foundation in Python and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and share everything in a way that’s helpful to others learning along the way.

## 📚 Course Overview

**Complete Python with DSA Bootcamp** is a beginner-friendly yet comprehensive program designed to transform you from a coding novice to a confident programmer ready to tackle technical interviews and real-world challenges.

### 💡 What I'm Learning

* **Python Programming**

  * Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators
  * Control Structures, Loops, Functions
  * Advanced Python: OOP, Error Handling
* **Data Structures**

  * Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues
  * Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
* **Algorithms**

  * Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort
  * Searching: Linear & Binary Search
  * Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming
* **Problem Solving**

  * Time & Space Complexity
  * Practice Problems and Coding Challenges
* **Projects**

  * Real-world mini-projects to apply the concepts
